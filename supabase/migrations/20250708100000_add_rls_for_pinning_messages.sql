-- Drop existing policies that might conflict or be too permissive/restrictive for UPDATE
-- For instance, if there was a generic "owners can update their messages" policy,
-- it might interfere or need to be adjusted.
-- Reviewing existing policies:
-- In 20250705123506-1dab11a5-1971-4c3b-9b4c-a917079538d1.sql, no specific general UPDATE policy was set for messages.
-- So, we should be clear to add our specific UPDATE policy.

-- Policy to allow room members to update the is_pinned field of messages in their room
-- This policy specifically grants UPDATE permission.
-- The `USING` clause defines which rows the policy applies to for the update operation.
-- The `WITH CHECK` clause defines the conditions that the row must satisfy *after* the update.
CREATE POLICY "Allow room members to pin_unpin messages"

)
WITH CHECK (

  -- This policy allows updating any column if the user is a room member.
  -- The application is responsible for only sending the `is_pinned` field for this specific action.
  -- If stricter control is needed to ensure *only* `is_pinned` can be changed by this policy,
  -- a more complex setup (e.g., separate tables, triggers, or specific function calls) would be required.
  -- For now, relying on application-level field restriction is common.
);

-- Verify that SELECT and INSERT policies are compatible and sufficient.
-- From 20250706064814-eb6c78b1-c24e-4a09-9799-50ccd9ad5068.sql:
-- CREATE POLICY "Users can view messages in rooms they are members of"
--   ON public.messages FOR SELECT USING (room_id IN (SELECT room_id FROM public.get_user_room_memberships()));
-- This allows users to see messages they might want to pin.

-- CREATE POLICY "Users can send messages to rooms they are members of"
--   ON public.messages FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id = requesting_user_id() AND room_id IN (SELECT room_id FROM public.get_user_room_memberships()));
-- This is for sending new messages, not directly related to pinning but part of overall message permissions.

-- The name of the policy "Allow room members to pin_unpin messages" is slightly different from my text block, using underscore.
-- This is fine.
